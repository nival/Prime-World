<!-- This is used as the "README" for binary distributions.  Using .HTA
     makes this a "HTML Application" and as such, can load Tamarin without
     prompting the user (whereas if it was HTML, the script would not be 
     executed until the user explicitly allowed it via the Info Bar.)

     This file is targetted at users of the binary distribution - see 
     README.txt in the source distribution for information targetted at
     developers of the script engine.

  <h2>The Tamarin Script Engine</h2>
  <p>
    The Tamarin Script Engine (also known as ScreamingMonkey) is an 
    ActiveScripting engine using the Open Source 
    <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/tamarin/">Tamarin</a> virtual machine.
    It allows you to use JavaScript 2 inside Internet Explorer, Windows Scripting Host,
    Active Server Pages, and any other application which supports ActiveScripting.
    For those who care, it is built using tamarin-central but will move to
    tamarin-tracing as soon as possible (see
    <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=431541">bug 431541</a>.)
  </p>
  <!-- a <div> that will be hidden by our script code - so if we aren't
       installed it remains visible
   -->
  <div id="not-installed">
    <h3>Oops!</h3>
    <p>It appears ScreamingMonkey is not working correctly, or has not
       been registered.  It can be registered manually by executing 
       <code>regsvr32.exe {install_path}\axtam.dll</code>, where 
       <code>{install_path}</code> is the location you installed the engine.
    </p>
    <p>If you contine to have problems, please see the contact information below</p>
  </div>

  <!-- This div only shows up when the engine is installed -->
  <div id="is-installed" style="display=none">

    <h3>Congratulations!</h3>
    <p>ScreamingMonkey has been installed and is working correctly.  Your web
       pages can include script blocks similar to</p>
    <pre>
      &lt;script language=&quot;application/javascript;version=2&quot;&gt;
        window.alert('hello from tamarin!');
      &lt;/script&gt;
    </pre>
    <p>to start taking advantage of the latest revision of JavaScript.  You
       can find one such script block at the bottom of the source for this page.</p>

    <h3>Getting Started</h3>
    <p>Demos and documentation is pretty thin at the moment, but we
       have included some <a href="test/">test HTML files</a> that you may like to browse.
    </p>
    <p>Check out the 
       <a href="http://wiki.mozilla.org/Tamarin:ScreamingMonkey">main project page</a>
       for current information</p>

    <h4>Using Tamarin with the Windows Scripting Host</h4>
    <p>Tamarin registers the <code>.js2</code> and <code>.es4</code> extensions,
       which means the Windows Scripting Host will automatically use the Tamarin
       engine for script files with these extensions.  For more information on
       WSH, please see
       <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/232211">Microsoft KB article 232211</a>
    </p>
    <p>A quick example: create a file named <code>hello.js2</code> with the contents:</p>
    <pre>WScript.Echo("Hello from WSH version " + WScript.Version)</pre>
    <p>and double-click on this file (alternatively, execute either
      <code>cscript.exe hello.js2</code> or <code>wscript.exe hello.js2</code>)
      and you should see a message box with the version of WSH you are running.
    </p>

  <h3>Known Issues</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      eval() doesn't work.
      <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=413434">(bug 413434)</a>
    </li>
    <li>
      Global object semantics don't work correctly - you must 
      always use the <code>window.</code> prefix when getting or setting
      any attributes on the global object
      <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=417342">(bug 417342)</a>
    </li>
    <li>
      JS2 is not yet fully implemented by the ESC compiler.  The compiler is
      being developed independently from ScreamingMonkey, so you may like
      to <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?product=Tamarin&component=Self-hosting+compiler+%28ESC%29&resolution=---">view ESC related bugs on bugzilla</a>
    </li>
    <li>
      Implicit event handlers don't work - you must use 
      <code>object.attachEvent(event_name, event_handler);</code> - see 
      <a href="test/events.html">test/events.html</a> for an example.
    </li>
    <li>
      The control is not signed.  This means IE may impose a stricter 
      security policy than for other script engines.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Contact Information</h3>
  <p>Contact us using email via the 
     <a href="https://mail.mozilla.org/listinfo/tamarin-devel">tamarin-devel mailing list</a>
     or you can report bugs via 
     <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=Tamarin&component=ScreamingMonkey">bugzilla</a>
     but please check the known-issues above before reporting problems (eg, 
     we already know that you must use a <code>window.</code> prefix when it 
     should not be necessary!).  The <code>#tamarin</code> channel on 
     irc.mozilla.org might also find someone who can help.
