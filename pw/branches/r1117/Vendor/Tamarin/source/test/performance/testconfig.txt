# operation:
#    skip - the test/dir is not run, for example the configuration does not support a feature or the file is not a test and is a helper file to another test
#    include - includes a specific testcase/dir even if the parent has been skipped
#    largerValuesFaster - test metric larger values indicate faster execution
