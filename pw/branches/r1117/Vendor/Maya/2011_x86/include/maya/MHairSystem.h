//! \ingroup OpenMayaFX
//! \brief Interface with Maya's Dynamic Hair System
/*!
  MHairSystem provides an interface with Maya's Dynamic Hair System.

  At present, this interface only supports the ability to override the
  geometry collision component of hair. There is currently no support
  for overriding the other hair collision components (i.e. implicit
  object collision and hair self collision).

  The rationale for providing a hair collision API is to allow the
  user to override Maya's internal algorithm which is a
  high-performance simulation. There is an example plug-in provided in
  the Developer's Toolkit called hairCollisionSolver.cpp.
