//! \brief Subdivision surface function set. 
/*!
This function set provides access to subdivision surfaces. Objects of type
MFn::kSubdiv, MFn::kSubdivData, and MFn::kSubdivGeom are supported.
MFn::kSubdiv objects are shapes in the DAG, MFn::kSubdivGeom objects are the
raw geometry that the shapes use, and MFn::kSubdivData objects are the data
that is passed through dependency graph connections.

Maya implements fully hierarchical Catmull-Clark quad based subdivision
surfaces.  You can use them without any hierarchical edits, but their full
power is only realized when you do use the hierarchy.  Using the hierarchy
lets you access additional vertices on the existing faces.  For example,
a single 4 vertex plane can give you access, through hierarchy, to over
16,000,000 points at the finest level of the hierarchy (please don't try it).
Additionally, the points at the finer levels are created only as you need them
and only in the areas where you need them, giving you an implied level of
detail workflow.

The "base" mesh is sometimes used to describe the coarsest level of the
hierarchy.  Once we go one level finer (to level "1") all faces are four
sided (though not all vertices are of valence 4).  At that point, each face
can be considered to have 4 "children" faces.  Starting with a 4 vertex single
face plane, there will be 4 faces (and 9 vertices) at level 1, 16 faces (and 25 vertices) at level 2, etc.  You can go as deep as level 12.

Please consult Maya documentation on subdivision surfaces for more details.

<b>Subdivision Surface Construction</b>
Subdivision surfaces are created by specifying a base polygonal mesh,
hierarchical edits (optional) and creases (optional).

The base mesh contains a vertex list,
a list of vertex counts per-polygon, and a list of vertices that make up
the polygons.  If you are familiar with the creation of polygonal meshes,
this is exactly equivalent to that setup.  With a small set of limitations,
any polygonal object can be converted into a subdivision surface.  The
current limitations are:

	\li <b>non manifold geometry</b>
	The polygons must be manifold; i.e., an edge has at most two incident
	faces.

	\li <b>vertex valence</b>
	A vertex must have valence of at least 3, unless it's a boundary vertex
	in which case it needs the valence of at least 2.

	\li <b>polygon vertex count</b>
	Maximal vertex count in a single polygon is 256.

	\li <b>total vertex count</b>
	Maximal vertex count in a base mesh is ~8,000,000 (2^23).

The easiest way to create a subdivision surface is probably to use
polyToSubdiv MEL command to create it from a polygon.  Alternativelly,
the same functionality is available through the API using
<b>createFromPolygon</b> method.

Alternatively, you can create a subdivision surface either by converting
an existing NURBS surface with <b>createFromNurbsSurface</b> or directly, by
specifying vertex lists, vertex connections lists, etc.  The last method will
look familiar to those that have used <b>MFnMesh::create</b> method to create
a polygon.

The following lists are used by the create method to construct a
subdivision surface:


	\li <b>vertex list</b>
	All of the vertices for the subdivision surface are stored in
	a master vertex list which is an array indexed from 0 to numVertices()-1.
	Vertices in this list can be shared among polygons.

	\li <b>polygon count list</b>
	This is a list containing the number of vertices for each polygon. Each
	polygon in the mesh would have an entry in this list containing its
	number of vertices.

	\li <b>vertex connection list</b>
	This is a list of the vertex id's for each polygon. Since polygons can
	have different numbers of vertices, the polygon count list is
	used to determine which polygons are represented by the various
	sections of this list.


<b>Texture Coordinates (UV's)</b>
You can optionally specify texture (uv) coordinates. UV coordinates are 2-d
coordinates used for mapping textures to the polygons of a surface.
Each polygon contains as many UV's as it has vertices.  The UV values are
not shared and you can think of them as "owned" by a polygon, rather than
each vertex in that polygon.

<b>Subdivision Surface Component API Names</b>

In order to successfully use the subdivision surface API, you need to
familiarize yourself with the naming convention used for its components
within the API.

In the polygon case, we simply number the vertices 0, 1, ... N-1.  The faces
and the edges and the faces are numbered similarly.

For the subdivision surfaces, this is not the case, mostly because of the
hierarchical approach we took.  Since it would be prohibitive to instantiate
all the faces all the time (think of those 16M that can from just one original
face) the names have to be order of creation independent.

The simplest way to think about each API name is "start with a face and follow
a path into the finer levels of the hierarchy recording each turn along the
way".

Here's some details.  You should also consult <b>MFnSubdNames</b> class which
contains a number of helpful methods for interpreting, creating and modifying
the component API names.  While this will take some getting used to, the
good news is that instantiating more vertices does not change the names
of the existing ones (unless you're adding more level 0 vertices) so any
vertex animation, etc. will not be affected by a need to model more detail
into another part of the surface.



	\li <b>base face name</b>
	Each component API name is "rooted" at one of the faces in the original,
	coarsest (level 0, "base") mesh.  These faces are numbered 0, 1, etc.

	\li <b>level</b>
	Each component exists only at a single level.  The value ranges from 0
	to 12.

	\li <b>level 1 choice</b>
	Coarsest faces can have up to 256 sides.  Finer faces are always four
	sided.  This portion of the name lets us decide which of the possibly
	256 level 1 faces we are choosing.

	\li <b>path from level 1</b>
	Once we are at a level 1 face, we go down to a finer face by choosing
	one of the four children.  This is recorded as two bits per level,
	giving us a "path" down to the desired level.

	\li <b>vertex/edge choice</b>
	For all but level 0 faces, once we know the face, we just have to choose
	one of the four edges or vertices.  This value is usually 0 for the faces
	(it is ignored).  In the case of the level 0 faces, this contains the
	full index of the vertex within that face

	\li <b>storage</b>
	Subdivision surface components (vertex, faces, names) are stored
	as single unsigned 64 bit integers (MUint64 type is defined in MTypes.h).
	The above 5 values are compressed into the 64 bit int storage. For those
	that want the gory details, the following is the way the components are
    currently organized within the 64 bits of data. However you should use
    the 5 values above and not this 64 bit value as the way these 5 values
    are packed into the 64 bit value may change in future.  The contents of
    the 64 bits are presented here from the highest value bit down to the
    lowest:

		\li {1} - unused
		\li {23} - base face name
		\li {8} - level 1 choice
		\li {2} - unused
		\li {4} - level
		\li {24} - path
		\li {2} - unused

For the subdivision surfaces, the most important names are those of
the faces.  Given a face name, each vertex on that face is named based
on that face.  That does mean that each vertex will typically have
more than one name.  Maya will always give you a unique name by
choosing the one that is numerically the smallest (in the 64 bit
sense).
