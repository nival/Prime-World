// CLASS DECLARATION (MTimerMessage)

//! \ingroup OpenMaya
//! \brief Register callbacks that are based on a fixed time interval. 
/*!

  This class is used to register callbacks that are called at fixed
  time intervals. Unlike other callbacks, a timer callback is executed
  with the highest priority within Maya and take precidence over *all*
  other Maya events.  Use with care as it is possible to construct a
  callback that will prevent any other part of Maya from running.

  The add callback method returns an id which is used to remove the
  callback.

  To remove a callback use MMessage::removeCallback.

  All callbacks that are registered by a plug-in must be removed by
  that plug-in when it is unloaded.  Failure to do so will result in
  a fatal error.
