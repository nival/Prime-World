//! \brief  Anim Curve Function Set
/*!
  Create, query and edit Anim Curve Nodes and the keys internal to
  those Nodes.

  Create an Anim Curve Node and connect its output to any animatable
  attribute on another Node.

  Evaluate an Anim Curve at a particular time.

  Determine the number of keys held by an Anim Curve.

  Determine the time and value of individual keys, as well as the
  (angle,weight) or (x,y) values and type of key tangents.  The
  in-tangent refers to the tangent entering the key.  The out-tangent
  refers to the tangent leaving the key.

  Find the index of the key at, or closest to a particular time.

  Set the time and value of individual keys, as well as the type of
  the tangent to the curve entering (in-tangent) and leaving
  (out-tangent) the key, specify the tangent as either (angle,weight)
  or (x,y).

  Add and remove keys from an Anim Curve.  Anim Curves are implemented
  as Dependency Graph (DG) Nodes. Each Node can have indexed keys.

  There are eight different types of Anim Curve nodes:

  \li timeToAngular (animCurveTA)
  \li timeToLinear (animCurveTL)
  \li timeToTime (animCurveTT)
  \li timeToUnitless (animCurveTU)
  \li unitlessToAngular (animCurveUA)
  \li unitlessToLinear (animCurveUL)
  \li unitlessToTime (animCurveUT)
  \li unitlessToUnitless (animCurveUU)

  Specifying the correct AnimCurveType during creation will avoid
  implicit unit conversion nodes.

  Use the Anim Curve Function Set to create Anim Curve Nodes and
  connect them to animatable attributes on DG Nodes, as well as to
  query and edit an Anim Curve Node and its keys.

  On creation, an Anim Curve Function Set may be attached to a given
  Anim Curve or it may be unattached.  The Function Set may be
  attached to a different Anim Curve Node using the setObject()
  methods inherited from the Base Function Set (MFnBase) or with the
  create() methods.

  Use the create() methods of an Anim Curve Function Set to create a
  new Anim Curve Node, attach the Function Set to the new Node and
  connect the output of the Node to a specific animatable Attribute or
  Plug of another Node.  Additionally, the output of an Anim Curve
  Node may be attached to an Attribute or Plug of another DG Node
  using the DG Modifier method MDGModifier::connect().

  Use the evaluate() methods to determine the value of an Anim Curve
  at a particular time or a given unitless input.

  Use the addKey() and remove() methods to add and remove keys to and
  from an Anim Curve.

  The query and edit methods of the Anim Curve Function Set act on
  keys at a specific 0-based index. [Note that the numKeys() method
  returns a 1-based value].  Keys can be accessed either randomly (via
  a 0-based index) or serially (using the find() and findClosest()
  methods).

  Use the find() or findClosest() methods to determine the index of a
  key at or closest to a specific time respectively.

  Use the specific query methods to determine the time, value and
  tangent information for a key at a given index.

  Use the specific edit methods to set the time, value and tangent
  information for a key at a given index.

  There are methods for setting the x,y values for the in- and
  out-tangents, as well as setting their angles and weights.

  Setting the time of a key will fail if the new time would require a
  re-ordering of the keys.  Use the remove() and addKey() methods to
  re-order the keys. Or use the keyframe command from mel.

  The Maya developer's kit ships with example code (animDemo) which
  demonstrates how to evaluate a Maya animation curve independent from
  Maya.  The animation parameter curves in Maya are defined by a
  restricted set of cubic two-dimensional Bezier curves. It is defined
  by four points.  P1 = (x1, y1) is the (key,value) pair for the first
  key.  P2 = (x2, y2) is a point which defines the outgoing tangent
  direction at P1.  P4 = (x4, y4) defines the second key and P3 = (x3,
  y3) is a point which defines the incoming tangent direction at P4.
  There are some basic restrictions for the x coordinates of these
  points: x1 <= x2 <= x3 <= x4.

  The 2-dimensional Bezier curve is defined as

  \code
  F(u) = [ u^3 u^2 u 1 ] * B * | P1 |   ,  0 <= u <= 1
                               | P2 |
                               | P3 |
                               | P4 |

       = [ B0(u) B1(u) B2(u) B3(u) ] * | x1 y1 |
                                       | x2 y2 |
                                       | x3 y3 |
                                       | x4 y4 |

   where B is the Bezier Basis matrix  | -1  3  -3  1 |
                                       |  3 -6   3  0 |
                                       | -3  3   0  0 |
                                       |  1  0   0  0 |
  \endcode

  F(u) yields a vector of two cubic polynomials [ Fx(u) Fy(u) ] which
  define an (x, y) position on the parameter curve for some u in the
  range [0,1].

  For an animation parameter curve, we are given the x position and
  want to know its corresponding y position.  To do this we use x =
  Fx(u) and solve for u.  Fx(u) is cubic and the restrictions on valid
  values for x2 and x3 guarantee there will be only one real root
  value for u. Once we know u, we can plug it into Fy(u) to get the y
  value.

  One important note is how the outgoing and incoming tangents
  directions for a key are saved internally and in the Maya Ascii file
  format.  Instead of being specified as points, the tangent
  directions are specified as vectors. The outgoing tangent direction
  at P1 is specified and saved as the vector 3*(P2 - P1) and the
  incoming tangent direction is specified and saved as the vector
  3*(P4 - P3).

  An animation curve is basically a restricted form of a bezier curve
  for which the keys serve as the control points and have tangent
  information embedded within them. There are two different methods
  for converting tangent information into the control points of the
  bezier hull and we have taken to calling the two methods weighted
  and non-weighted tangents.

  The animation curve is evaluated in a piecewise manner, which means
  that each segment between two keys is evaluated on its own, without
  regards to any other segment. The only time keys outside of a
  segment are considered is when tangent values are calculated for the
  spline, clamped and plateau tangent types.

  When evaluating an animation curve, a two stage process is used:
  <ol>
  <li> the evaluation time is examined to determine if it falls within
  the range of the animation curve, and if it does not evaluation is based
  upon the infinity settings for the animation curve.
  <li>if the evaluation time falls within the range of the animation
  curve, the bezier parameters of the curve are computed and used
  as described below.
  </ol>

  Animation curves may have either weighted or non-weighted tangents.
  With non-weighted tangents, tangents are implemented as vectors and
  P2 and P3 are internally adjusted to account for the time difference
  between P1 and P4.

  When evaluating a time within a segment, the following algortithms
  are used:

  \code
For weighted tangents:
	where x is the start of the segment
	given the bezier x parameters a', b', c', d', find the parameter t
	which satisfies the formula:
		(time - x) = (t^3 * a') + (t^2 + b') + (t * c') + d'
	with t (and the bezier y parameters a, b, c, d) compute the value as:
		v = (t^3 * a) + (t^2 + b) + (t * c) + d

For non-weighted tangents:
	where x is the start of the segment
	compute the parameter t as time - x
	with t (and the bezier y parameters a, b, c, d) compute the value as:
		v = (t^3 * a) + (t^2 + b) + (t * c) + d
  \endcode
