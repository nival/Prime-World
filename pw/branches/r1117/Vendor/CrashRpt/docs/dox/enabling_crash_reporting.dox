\page enabling_crash_reporting Enabling Crash Reporting and Adding Files to Crash Report

This page describes how to initialize CrashRpt and how to add various files to crash report.

\section enabling Enabling Crash Reporting

To enable crash reporting support in your C++ application you use crInstall() function. 
The function crInstall() installs exception handlers that work for the entire process. Typically you
call the crInstall() in the beginning of your \b main() or \b WinMain() function. 

You pass configuration settings to crInstall() through the \ref CR_INSTALL_INFO structure. The configuration
settings include application name and version, recipient's e-mail address or URL, path for saving error reports,
Privacy Policy URL and so on.

On application exit, you use the crUninstall() function to unset exception handlers 
and uninitialize CrashRpt. 

<b>A note for MFC users.</b>

If your application is MFC-based, you should override your <i>CWinApp::Run()</i> method and install CrashRpt there. 
In the CPP file containing your App class, add the following code:

\code
int CYourApp::Run() 
{
  // Call your crInstall code here ...

  BOOL bRun;
  BOOL bExit=FALSE;
  while(!bExit)
  {
    bRun= CWinApp::Run();
    bExit=TRUE;
  }

  // Uninstall CrashRpt here...

  return bRun;
}
\endcode

\section thread_crash_handlers Per-thread Installation

Some of exception handlers work for entire process and others work for the caller thread
only. Because of this reason, if your application is multi-threaded, you have to additionally install
exception handlers in each worker thread.

The function crInstallToCurrentThread2() installs exception handlers that work on per-thread basis. 
In a multi-threaded program you call the crInstallToCurrentThread2() for all 
threads except the main one. Typically you call this function in the beginning of the thread
procedure.

Just before the return from the thread procedure, call the
crUninstallFromCurrentThread() function to unset exception handlers from the caller thread. No need to call the
crUninstallFromCurrentThread() function in the main execution thread, because crUninstall() will do that for
you automatically.

The crInstallToCurrentThread2() and crUninstallFromCurrentThread() functions provide you with
full control on when to install/uninstall thread exception handlers and which of them to install. 
But, sometimes it may be desired to install thread exception handlers automatically. For example,
if you you need to catch exceptions in a thread created by a third-party module, but you don't have access 
to that module's source code. 

Since v.1.4.2, you can ask CrashRpt to install the per-thread exception handlers 
automatically by specifying the \ref CR_INST_AUTO_THREAD_HANDLERS flags for \ref CR_INSTALL_INFO::dwFlags
structure field. If this flag is specified, CrashRpt will install all available thread exception handlers 
in response on <b>DllMain()</b>'s reson codes \b DLL_THREAD_ATTACH/DLL_THREAD_DETACH. This flag has
effect only when CrashRpt is compiled as a DLL (it does not work if CrashRpt is compiled as a static library).

\section wrappers Convenience Wrappers

You can use \ref CrashRptWrappers to simplify installation and uninstallation of exception
handlers in your program. 

Use CrAutoInstallHelper wrapper class to install exception handlers in your
\b main() function. In a multi-threaded program, use CrThreadAutoInstallHelper wrapper class to 
install exception handlers in each worker thread.
	
\section crash_callback Notifying the Application on Crash

Sometimes the client application should be notified on crash to be able to perform some actions.
You can define a crash callback function (see PFNCRASHCALLBACK() prototype) and pass its pointer to crSetCrashCallback()
function. The specified crash callback function will be called on crash and information about
the crash will be passed to the callback function through the \ref CR_CRASH_CALLBACK_INFO
structure.

It is generally unsafe to do complex actions (e.g. memory allocation, heap operations) 
inside of this callback, because the application state may be unstable.

For example, the application may use this callback for closing handles to open 
log files that the application plans to include into the error report. Log files 
should be accessible for reading, otherwise CrashRpt won't be able to include them 
into error report.           

Crash callback function can also be used to allow the client application to continue its
execution after crash report generation. 
By default, CrashRpt terminates the client application after crash report generation, because the app
may be in unstable state. But, if for some reason you need to continue client app's execution,
you may do this by setting CR_CRASH_CALLBACK_INFO::bContinueExecution structure field to \a TRUE.

\section testing_if_intercepted Testing If Exceptions are Intercepted

When you install crash reporting support to your program, it is important to test if CrashRpt
intercepts exceptions properly. Use \ref crEmulateCrash() function to emulate an exceptional situation. 
You may call this function in each thread of your program to ensure all exceptions will be caught.

\section adding_crashdump Adding Crash Minidump File

By default, CrashRpt generates crash minidump file on crash and includes it into the crash report.
You can specify what minidump type to generate using \ref CR_INSTALL_INFO::uMiniDumpType
structure member. The default minidump type is <b>MiniDumpNormal</b>. For the list of available 
minidump types, see the documentation for the \b MiniDumpWriteDump() function in MSDN.

The crash minidump file is generated with the Microsoft Debug Help library (<i>dbghelp.dll</i>).
By default, CrashRpt searches for <i>dbghelp.dll</i> using the default search sequence (the directory
where <i>CrashRpt.dll</i> is located, then system directory). Optionally,
you may specify the path to <i>dbghelp.dll</i> using the \ref CR_INSTALL_INFO::pszDebugHelpDLL structure
member.

It is also possible to disable crash minidump generation by specifying the \ref CR_INST_NO_MINIDUMP 
flag for \ref CR_INSTALL_INFO::dwFlags structure member.

\section adding_a_custom_file Adding a Custom File

Typically an application creates and maintains a log file where operations and errors are
written. Such a log file can be helpful for crash analysis and should be added to your application's error
report. You add application-specific files to the error report using crAddFile2() function.

\section allow_delete Allowing User to Attach or Delete Files

Typically, application developer decides what files to add into error report.
Hovewer, it may be needed to let an end user (or a quality assurance engineer) 
to attach new files to error report or remove existing files from error report. 

To let user remove a file from error report, you have to pass
the \ref CR_AF_ALLOW_DELETE flag to crAddFile2() function. When this flag is specified,
user will be able to right-click the file in <i>Error Report Details</i> dialog
and choose <i>Delete Selected File(s)</i> from the context menu to delete the file.
Note that user is unable to delete standard files, such as <i>crashrpt.xml</i> or
<i>crashdump.dmp</i>.

To let user attach more files to error report, specify the \ref CR_INST_ALLOW_ATTACH_MORE_FILES
flag for \ref CR_INSTALL_INFO::dwFlags structure member. When this is specified,
the user will be able to right-click the list of files on <i>Error Report Details</i>
dialog and choose <i>Attach More File(s)</i> item from the context menu. The <i>Open File</i>
dialog appears in which user can select what files to attach.

\section adding_a_custom_property Adding a Custom Property

One way to add application-defined info to the error report is adding a file as described above. But
sometimes you may want to extend the crash description XML file by adding a named literal property to the
file. You can do this through the crAddProperty() function. 

For example, you may need to add the info about the amount of free disk space on a specific disk drive 
at the moment of crash, or about the version of the graphics card driver. 

\section adding_a_screenshot Adding a Screen Shot

Screen shots may help to see which button user clicked before the crash, to see the desktop state and easier 
reproduce the crash. You can make a screen shot of user's virtual screen or a screen shot of your main window using 
the crAddScreenshot2() function. 

By enabling screenshot capture, you should be careful 
about user's privacy. Some parts of the desktop screenshot may contain private or user identifying 
information: folder names, wallpapers, photos, text fragments and so on. 
CrashRpt allows to fill some areas of the screen shot with black color to respect
end user's privacy. For example, sometimes it may be enough to see only the region of the desktop occupied by your application 
and not the rest of desktop. 

It is also recommended that you always provide a link to your Privacy Policy page describing what information you collect on 
crash and what purposes you use it for. By clicking the Send Report button, user confirms he/she is familiar 
with the contents of the error report and accepts the terms of the Privacy Policy.

\section adding_video Adding a Video of a Crash

As of v.1.4.0, CrashRpt is able to capture end user's desktop and record what happened 
just before crash to an .ogg video file and include the file to crash report. The recorded information may help the 
software vendor to better understand what actions the end user performed before client application 
crashed and reproduce the error.

To record the desktop state to a video file and add the file to crash report,
use the \ref crAddVideo() function. 

When the function is called, the notification dialog is displayed (see below). 
If the end user agrees to capture the screen and record the video, he/she
clicks the 'Allow' button; otherwise he/she clicks the 'Cancel' button.

\image html video_rec.png "Video Recording Dialog"

The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ogg">OGG</a> together with
<a href="">Theora</a> are widely used video container and video codec, respectively, 
provided by the open-source OGG Project.
OGG files can be opened and played in a browser like Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox or in 
another video player understanding this format, like ffmpeg.

Although it is up to you (software vendor) to decide when to capture end user's screen, 
it is not recommended to do that always on your application's start up,
because screen capture continuously consumes CPU resources and disk space. Instead, it is recommended to implement some
GUI option (for example, a checkbox in your Application Settings dialog) allowing end user
to enable this feature when necessary. An alternative way is to let your application automatically decide when
to enable screen capture feature. For example, you app could enable screen capture if several crashes
happen with it on end user's machine.

\section adding_a_reg_key Adding a Registry Key

Many applications store settings inside of Windows registry. Application's settings might be useful for crash 
analysis. You can ask CrashRpt to dump a registry key contents on crash. Use the \ref crAddRegKey() function.

\section handling_errors Handling Errors in CrashRpt Functions

Typically, CrashRpt API functions return zero value if succeeded and non-zero if failed 
(refer to certain function's documentation for the meaning of function's return value). To get
text error message of the last called function, use the crGetLastErrorMsg() function.

\section specifying_privacy_policy Specifying the Privacy Policy File

Crash information collected by CrashRpt may contain some user-identifying or private data 
(e.g. desktop screenshots and so on). That's why you should 
always provide a link to your Privacy Policy file describing what information you collect on 
crash and what purposes you use it for. By clicking the Send Report button, user confirms he/she is familiar 
with the contents of the error report and accepts the terms of the Privacy Policy. 

To specify the file containing your Privacy Policy text, use the \ref CR_INSTALL_INFO::pszPrivacyPolicyURL
structure member. This parameter can be either a web-based URL (e.g. <i>http://example.com/privacy.html</i>),
or an absolute path to local file (e.g. <i>file:///C:/MyApp/privacy.html</i>). The file
may be an HTML page, a TXT file or an RTF file.

\section order_of_function_calls The Order of Function Calls

Typically, you call the functions described above in the following order:
 - Initialize CrashRpt with \ref crInstall() function;
 - Add custom files, properties, desktop screenshots, video, registry keys to the error report;
 - Run the main application code or window message loop;
 - When the main application code exits, uninitialize CrashRpt with \ref crUninstall();
 - Exit the application.  

In general, you may add files, properties, desktop screenshots, video, registry keys any time
after you call the \ref crInstall() function and before you call the \ref crUninstall() function.
It is also possible (but not recommended) to add those files inside of the crash callback function.

For a CrashRpt API usage example, please refer to \ref simple_example page.
