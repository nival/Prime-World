\page using_minidump Using Crash Minidump
  
A crash minidump file (DMP file) contains various information about the state of 
the application at the moment of time when it crashed.                           

\note 
The minidump file is created as follows. All the threads of the parent process are suspended, 
and a "snapshot" of the process is recorded. The snapshot includes the names 
and versions of all DLL-modules loaded into the process and the list of threads 
that work in the process. For each of those threads, call stack image is recorded. 
Also, the information about the version of the operating system, the number of CPUs 
and their brand names are written to minidump file. 

\note The minidump is usually created with the help of the DbgHelp DLL's 
\b MiniDumpWriteDump() function. For additional information on the 
\b MiniDumpWriteDump() function, please refer to MSDN.

Technically, the crash minidump file may contain:
  - general system information (OS version, CPU count, etc.);
  - blocks of process memory (including values of global variables, 
    the call stack and local variables for each execution thread);
  - the list of loaded and unloaded modules (including their versions 
    and timestamps).

Minidump size is typically about several tens of kilobytes, but 
the actual content of the minidump depends on the minidump type you pass 
as the value of the \ref CR_INSTALL_INFO::uMiniDumpType field.

To analyze crash minidump files generated by the CrashRpt library, 
you typically open those files in Visual Studio or in WinDbg. 
The following two sections of this page describe minidump opening 
instructions in details:
  - \ref opening_minidump_in_vs 
  - \ref opening_minidump_in_windbg 

\note In order to recover the stack trace from the crash minidump, 
you need the debugging symbols (program database, PDB) generated by the 
compiler/linker for modules of your application. You may also need the source
code of your application to be able to edit the place in the
code where the crash happened.

\section opening_minidump_in_vs Opening Minidump in Visual Studio

In order to illustrate how to open a minidump file in Visual Studio, 
we will use a minidump file created for the <i>WTLDemo.exe</i> demo 
application which is distributed with CrashRpt distribution archive. 

To create such a minidump, you can follow the steps below:

  - Compile (if you haven't yet compiled) the CrashRpt in Release 
    configuration as described on \ref compiling_crashrpt page. 

  - Go to the <i>bin</i> directory under the top-level directory of 
    CrashRpt distribution. You can see that Visual Studio has 
    created several EXE and DLL binary files (<i>WTLDemo.exe</i>, <i>CrashRptXXXX.dll</i>, etc.) 
    and PDB files for those binaries (<i>WTLDemo.pdb</i>, <i>CrashRptXXXX.pdb</i>, etc.) The XXXX is the placeholder
    for the actual version of CrashRpt library. 

  - Save the binary files and PDB files to some folder (see also
    \ref preparing_to_software_release page for additional information). 
    
Finally, you should have a directory structure like this:

  - WTLDemo
    - 1.4.1
       - WTLDemo.exe 
       - WTLDemo.pdb
       - CrashRpt1401.dll
       - CrashRpt1401.pdb

  - Save the source code of the WTLDemo application to some directory (we will need it later). 
    The source code of the WTLDemo app is located inside of <i>\\demos\\WTLDemo</i> subdirectory
    under the top-level directory of CrashRpt distribution. 

\note If you use SVN or another version control system for 
      storing your code, you can just mark the revision with 
      a tag to be able to restore the state of the code at any time.

  - Next, go to the <i>bin</i> directory again and run the <i>WTLDemo.exe</i>. When the dialog appears, click the
    "Crash" button. When <i>Error Report</i> dialog appears, click the "What does this error report contains?"
    link. Then in the <i>Error Report Details</i> dialog, click the "Export..." button to export the error report
    files as a ZIP archive. Export your error report to some directory.

  - Unzip the error report archive. It contains <i>crashdump.dmp</i> file and several other files.
                                                                         
Now, when you have the <i>crashdump.dmp</i> file, you can open it in Visual Studio. In order to open crash minidump file, 
double-click its file name. 

\note Alternatively, if you have several versions of Visual Studio installed (for example a 
commercial one and an Express edition) right-click the filename and in the context menu select <i>Open With</i> 
and then choose what Visual Studio version to use. 

A new Visual Studio window appears displaying general information on the <i>crashdump.dmp</i> (see the figure below).

\image html crashdump_sln.png "Visual Studio: crashdump.dmp"

In the Visual Studio window, click the <i>Debug with Native Only</i> 
to load the minidump data. When the data has been loaded, 
you should be able to see the dialog containing information about the 
exception, such as exception address, module name, exception code and 
its textual description (see the figure below). Press the 'Break'
button to continue.

\image html vs_unhandled_exception.png "Unhandled Exception Message"
 
In the <i>Output</i> window, you should be able to see the log of 
minidump loading progress. If you do not see the <i>Output window</i>, 
open menu <i>View</i> and click the <i>Output</i> menu item. 

\image html output_window.png "Output Window"

Now look at the <i>Modules</i> window. If you do not see such a window, 
open menu <i>Debug->Windows</i> and select the <i>Modules</i> menu item. 
Click the <i>Symbol Status</i> column header twice to sort modules by symbol 
load status in descending order. Now you should be able to see what symbols 
have beel loaded for <i>WTLDemo.exe</i> and <i>CrashRptXXXX.dll</i> modules. 

\image html modules.png "Modules: Symbols load status for each module"
   
As the debug symbols seem to be loaded successfully for the main modules 
of the application, in the code window (see the figure below) you should be able to see the place 
in your source code where the exception occurred. We can see that the crash 
occurred in file <i>CrashRpt.cpp</i> at line 829 inside of crEmulateCrash() 
function because of assigning a null pointer variable with the value 0. 
If the reason of the crash is clear, you even can edit the source code 
right in place to fix the problem. 

\image html code_line.png "Line of the code where exception occurred"

\note If line numbers are not displayed (this is the default), open menu
<i>Tools->Options...</i>, in appeared dialog's tree choose <i>Text Editor->C++</i>,
and then set the check mark in the <i>Line numbers</i> field.

You can see the values of local variables by moving the mouse cursor over the 
variable name. The value (if known) is displayed in a tooltip window. Not 
all variable's values can be recovered, this depends on the minidump
type you use and on other factors, such as code optimizations.

In order to better understand the reason of the crash, we would like to know 
what C++ class or function called the crEmulateCrash() function and for what 
purpose. We can do that with the help of the <i>Call stack</i> window 
(see the figure below). If the Call stack window is hidden, open menu 
<i>Debug->Windows</i> and select the 'Call Stack' menu item.

\image html call_stack.png "Call Stack"

Each line (also called a <i>stack frame</i>) of the stack trace contains 
the name of module the code belongs to, the name of symbol (function or 
class), offset from beginning of symbol code, source file and line number. 
Moving down the stack, we can see that crEmulateCrash() was called by the 
<b>CMainDlg::DoCrash()</b> class method, which, in turn was called by 
the <b>CMainDlg::OnOK()</b> method as the result of button click.  

Typically, the program has several execution threads. You can switch 
between threads using the <i>Threads</i> tab and browse the stack for 
each thread. We can see that there are two threads in the application: 
the main thread and the worker thread. The exception occured 
in the main thread, the second thread didn't crash.

\image html threads.png "Threads Window"

Finally, when you have finished with analyzing minidump data, close the Visual Studio window. 

\section troubleshooting_pdb Troubleshooting

The case described above is the easiest one, because Visual Studio located 
all binaries, PDB files and source files automatically. But in general, 
there may be some problems with reading minidumps, when Visual Studio can't locate 
those files, or when the timestamps of those files do not match. 

In order to locate matching binaries, PDB files and source code files, 
Visual Studio uses the absolute paths embedded into the PDB file 
at the time of compilation and linking. So, when you do not delete/move/modify 
the files you used to build the solution, Visual Studio can locate them 
automatically. But, if you delete/move or modify those files, Visual Studio
won't be able to locate them. 

In order to illustrate such a case, we will remove the entire <i>bin</i> and <i>\\demos\\WTLDemo</i> 
folders containing WTLDemo's source code we used for compilation, together 
with resulting binaries and PDB files. Then if we open the minidump file again, in the <i>Modules</i> window
we will see that the symbols could not be loaded (see the figure below).  

\image html no_symbols_loaded.png "No Symbols Loaded"

Symbol status for <i>WTLDemo.exe</i> 
and <i>CrashRpt1401.dll</i> modules shows that 
there were no matching binaries found. In order to fix this, you 
should specify symbol search path manually. In the minidump window, 
click the <i>Set symbol paths</i> and enter the path to the directory 
where your PDB files are located (see the figure below for example). 

\image html symbols_load_paths.png "Where to load symbols from"

Now reload the minidump. You can see that the stack trace is now recovered
correctly. But there is still one problem - the correct source code files are not displayed. 
In the <i>Call Stack</i> window, double-click the topmost stack frame. A dialog titled 'Find Source: crashrpt.cpp'
will appear. In this dialog, browse to the folder where you saved the source code 
and pick the <i>crashrpt.cpp</i> file. Now the correct source file should 
be displayed in Visual Studio source code window.

At this point, you should be able to read the minidump correctly. 
If the problem remains, follow the instructions below:                        

- Ensure that correct matching binaries and/or PDB files were 
  saved after compilation. Ensure you save excatly the same 
  binaries and PDB files that were generated during the 
  compilation/linking process. If you rebuild (or partially rebuild) 
  your solution, you should save those files again.

- If symbols for some modules of your program are loaded, 
  and you are still unable to read the stack trace, than
  there were no debugging symbols generated for the module 
  where crash had occurred. Check that you set Program Database 
  (/Zi) compiler flag and Generate Debug Info (/DEBUG) linker flag 
  for all modules of your application. For additional info, see \ref prgdb.

- If the stack trace is not as accurate as you expect, the reason may be 
  the code optimizations. It is recommended that you turn the frame pointer
  omission (FPO) optimizations off.

\section opening_minidump_in_windbg Opening Minidump in WinDbg

You can use \b WinDbg program from <b>Microsoft Debugging Tools for Windows</b> for opening 
crash minidumps. It is freely distributed. 

To open the minidump file, launch WinDbg and open the crash 
dump by pressing <i>CTRL+D</i> key combination. In the appeared Open File
dialog, pick the <i>crashdump.dmp</i> and press the Open button.
The <i>Command</i> window appears (see the figure below) allowing you to enter commands and
see the output.

\image html dbghelp_open_minidump.png "Opening a crash minidump in WinDbg"

Next, you need to set the symbol path for WinDbg with the \c .sympath command. Switch 
to the command window (ALT+1) and enter \c .sympath followed by a space followed by the 
semi-colon delimited list of directories to search.

\code
.sympath D:\Projects\symbols\WTLDemo\1.4.1
\endcode

Similarly you need to set the executable and source search paths with the .exepath 
and \c .srcpath commands.

\code
.exepath D:\Projects\symbols\WTLDemo\1.4.1
.srcpath D:\Projects\WTLDemo
\endcode

The final step is to change the debugger context to the context record associated 
with the exception by entering the \c .ecxr command.

\code
.ecxr
\endcode

If everything is configured correctly, you should now be able to walk the call stack, 
see local variables, and loaded modules. You can even have WinDbg highlight the offending 
line of code by double clicking the WTLDemo frame in the Call Stack window (ALT+6). 
Note: The exact line number may be a little off due to linker optimizations.
