======= Change History ========

- New: Added an ability to add multiple files to crash reports with crAddFile2() 
       using file search pattern (e.g. "*.log"). This implements feature request
       described in issue 190.

- New: Added new flag CR_INST_AUTO_THREAD_HANDLERS allowing to 
       install/uninstall exception handlers automatically in DllMain() 
       on DLL_THREAD_ATTACH/DETACH (issue 185).

- New: adjusting dump privileges to avoid error 'Only part of a ReadProcessMemory
       or WriteProcessMemory request was completed.'

- Fixed: Screenshot file still sent even if deleted (issue 186).
- Fixed: Video division by zero (issue 189)
- Fixed: Video missing from report (issue 187)
- Fixed: No crash data is sent to URL when we have a redirect (Issue 191)
- Fixed: CCrashHandler.m_hWndVideoParent not initialized to a 
         default value (issue 195)


--- Ver. 1.4.1 ---

- New: Added an ability to preview OGG video files in Error Report Details dialog.
       To preview a file, select it in the list of files.

- New: Added an bility for end user to delete screenshots, registry keys and video file
       from crash report through context menu of Error Report Details dialog 
       (added CR_AS_ALLOW_DELETE flag for crAddScreenshot2() function,
        CR_AR_ALLOW_DELETE flag for crAddRegKey() function and CR_AV_ALLOW_DELETE
        flag for crAddVideo() function). (issue 183) 

- New: Added back the crExceptionFilter() function removed previously as deprecated. 
       It seems that some users require that function. (issue 175).

- New: Extended unit tests (added ExceptionHandlerTests) (issue 114)

- Fixed: Exception handling problems (issue 180)
- Fixed: Update italian language file (issue 174)
- Fixed again: HTTPS certificate problem (issue 151)
- Fixed: Custom property cleared by adding other property (issue 176)
- Fixed: Running crprober on windows 7 results in no stack trace output (issue 182)


--- Ver. 1.4.0 ---

- New: CrashRpt is now able to capture end user's desktop and record what happened 
       just before crash to an .ogg video file and include the file to crash report. 
       The recorded information may help the software vendor to better understand 
       what actions the end user performed before client application crashed and 
       reproduce the error (issue 122). 

- New: Added new crAddVideo() function to record the desktop state to a video file 
       and add the file to crash report.

- New: Added code of Theora video codec and OGG container (libtheora and libogg).

- New: New-style crash callback replacing the obsolete LPGETLOGFILE() callback.
       Added PFNCRASHCALLBACK() callback function prototype, CR_CRASH_CALLBACK_INFO
       structure and crSetCrashCallback() function.

- New: Added an ability to continue program execution after crash. This can be performed
       through crash callback (see CR_CRASH_CALLBACK_INFO::bContinueExecution structure
       member). This partially implements feature request in issue 125.

- New: Removed deprecated constant CR_INST_ALL_EXCEPTION_HANDLERS, use CR_INST_ALL_POSSIBLE_HANDLERS
       constant instead.

- New: Removed legacy method of error report delivery as Base-64-encoded data.
       Now binary-encoded HTTP uploads are always used instead. This makes the
       constant CR_INST_HTTP_BINARY_ENCODING useless.

- Fixed: Memory Leak (or rather memory not deallocated before program exit) (issue 169)
- Fixed: Can not restart application. Use CR_INST_APP_RESTART flag (issue 165)


--- Ver. 1.3.1 ---

- New: Removed support of obsolete Visual Studio .NET 2003. 

- New: Removed deprecated functions crAddFileA(), crAddFileW(), 
       crInstallToCurrentThread(), crExceptionFilter() and deprecated 
       constant CR_WIN32_STRUCTURED_EXCEPTION.

- New: Improved robustness to stack overflow (issue 121). Now stack overflow is handled
       in separate thread makeing CrashRpt more robust to problem of not enogh stack memory.
       
- New: Added constant CR_STACK_OVERFLOW that can be passed to crEmulateCrash() function
       to cause stack overflow.

- New: Added an ability to attach more files to error report or delete selected files
       from error report through context menu of Error Report Details dialog (issue 132).
       Introduced new flag CR_INST_ALLOW_ATTACH_MORE_FILES for crInstall() function. 

- New: Added new CR_AF_ALLOW_DELETE flag for crAddFile2() function. If this flag is specified, 
       the user will be able to delete the file from error report using context menu of 
       Error Report Details dialog. (issue 132)

- New: Added support of SMTP authentication (AUTH LOGIN) (Issue 143).

- New: Added an ability to store the user's E-mail address and re-use later. When user
       enters his E-mail into "Your E-mail" field of Error Report dialog, the address
       is  saved and stored in ~CrashRpt.ini file. When a crash occurs
       later, the address is filled in automatically. (issue 155)

- New: Added CR_INST_SEND_MANDATORY flag. This flag removes the "Close" and "Other actions" 
       buttons from Error Report dialog, thus making the sending procedure mandatory for user 
       (issue 126).

- New: Added CR_INST_SHOW_ADDITIONAL_INFO_FIELDS flag. This flag makes "Your E-mail" and 
       "Describe what you were doing when the problem occurred" fields of Error Report 
       dialog always visible. By default (when this parameter not specified),
       those fields are hidden and user needs to click the "Provide additional info 
       (recommended)" link to show them (issue 129).

- New: Introduced command line parameter /terminate for CrashSender.exe. 
       This resolves a problem with installers that will want to update the exe file; 
       there was no way to tell the sender exe program to exit now (issue 142).
       Launching "CrashSender.exe /terminate" would look for all open CrashSender.exe processes 
       and terminate them immediately (without sending reports or waiting for completion). 
       Terminating the process is acomplished with TerminateProcess(hProcess) function.

- New: Reorganized demos (moved to demos folder and renamed CrashRptTest=>WTLDemo, crashcon=>ConsoleDemo).

- New: Added new demo application - MFCDemo. This is to demonstrate usage of CrashRpt
       with MFC-based apps.

- New: Refactored code of CrashSender project making it more conforming to 
       the Model-View-Controller methodology.

- Fixed: Impossible to send Crash reports in Windows 7 64bits (issue 104).
- Fixed: Crash report is not discarded when 'Close the program' is selected (issue 94).
- Fixed: Application is restarted twice after crash (issue 115).
- Fixed: CRP_COL_PROBLEM_DESCRIPTION not working (issue 118).
- Fixed: When copying a log file into the crash archive, access it with FILE_SHARE_WRITE (issue 124)

- Fixed: Memory allocation in CCrashHandler::GetExceptionPointers can fail (issue 157)
- Fixed: Timestamp of saved files (issue 135)
- Fixed: CErrorReportSender::DumpRegKey is omitting some subkeys and some values (issue 162)
- Fixed: CErrorReportSender::DumpRegKey issue with REG_BINARY (issue 130).
- Fixed: Order of custom properties (issue 131).

  To compile in VS2010, use Visual Studio 2010 project files (or use CMake to generate Visual Studio project 
  files for your favorite version of Visual Studio).

- Binary files now have version suffices (CrashRpt1300.dll, CrashRptProbe1300.dll and CrashSender1300.exe). This is
  to resolve problems of loading incorrect version of the DLL.
