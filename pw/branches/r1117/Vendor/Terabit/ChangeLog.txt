Version Terabit2_566.2
-------------------------                                      
  Fixed errors:
  missing ready signals for edge-triggered providers in 
  TRB_POSIX_AIO_FD_Info::execute_write_list () and 
  TRB_POSIX_AIO_FD_Info::execute_read_list () methods. 

  Improvment in TRB_POSIX_Asynch_Connect_Result::start_impl ():
  Immediate failure in connect () call is interpreted 
  as "operation completed with errors" rather than "unable to
  start operation". Such behavior is compatible with Windows.


Version Terabit2_566.1
-------------------------
  Added support of kqueue for BSD and MacOS OS families.
  The new provider's name is TRB_POSIX_AIO_Kqueue_Provider and
  the corresponded proactor configuration is wrappred in class 
  TRB_Kqueue_Proactor. To compile TRB_POSIX_AIO_Kqueue_Provider the
  macro ACE_HAS_KQUEUE must be defined in config.h



  TProactor now supports UNIX domain sockets (AF_UNIX family)
  in addition to AF_INET/AF_INET6 families. The new internal class
  TRB_Sock_Addr can encapsulate any ACE socket address class:
  ACE_INET_Addr or ACE_UNIX_Addr.
  Potentially this class can be extened to support any address family.
  Although  this class in not exposed to the developer, he(she) can freely
  use it.
 
  Asynch_Acceptor/Asynch_Connector deals only with the base ACE_Addr class
  and recongnize the real address family.

  Class TRB_Sevrice_Handler is replaced by template class:

        template <class ADDRESS> class TRB_Service_Handler_T;
  
  To preserve compatibility with previous TProactor and ACE
  TRB_Service_Handler is defined as

  typedef TRB_Service_Handler_T<ACE_INET_Addr> TRB_Service_Handler;
 
    

Version Terabit2_561.4
-------------------------
  SSL_Asynch_Stream: added  ERR_clear_error call before SSL_read, SSL_write
                                                                        
  Asynch_Read_Dgram/Asynch_Write_Dgram: restored compatibility with ACE,
  i.e. parameters bytes_read/bytes_write do not limit the max bytes to
  transfer.

  WIN32_Asynch_IO: special processing for ERROR_HANDL_EOF, so EOF error is
  always delivered as completion and not as start error.

  POSIX_AIO_Event_Poll_Provider: ignored error EPERM

  POSIX_AIO_FD_Info: file descriptor initially during open() marked as
  ready to READ and WRITE. With above POSIX_AIO_Event_Poll_Provider change 
  it allows faked AIO processing for regular files (hard drives,etc)

  POSIX_AIO_LINUX_NAIO_Provider: improved diagnostic

  F2_Test: new test only for regular files (no socket, pipes)
  mostly designed to test LINUX NAIO (KAIO) and WIN32 , 
  but it must work and works for any Proactor   


Version Terabit2_561.3
-------------------------
  Added read_n/readv_n methods to TRB_Asynch_Read_Stream
  and   write_n/writev_n methods to TRB_Asynch_Write_Stream.

  For POSIX emulation providers : write/writev work as write_n/writev_n by default.
  This is done for compatibility with Windows overlapped I/O.

  read_n/readv_n are supported correctly only for POSIX emulation providers.
  For POSIX native providers and for Windows read_n/readv_n  behave as read/readv. 

  Thanks to Martin Scholl for that.
    

Version Terabit2_561.2
-------------------------
  Fixed missprint errors in POSIX_AIO_SUN_Provider and 
  POSIX_AIO_SUN_Port_Provider.

Version Terabit2_561.1
-------------------------
  Compiled with ACE 5.6.1, fixed minor issues
  ACE 5.6 does not have ACE_FD_SET_TYPE (fd_set)
  
  TProactor:
  Fixed Asynch_IO_Impl.cpp  - very very old bug still existing in ACE
  and inherited from WIN32_Asynch_IO.cpp
  in assembling iovec from chain of ACE_Message_Block's.
  
  Fixed SEGV in POSIX_SUN_Provider.cpp
  Still POSIX and SUN aio  have bad scalabity and performance,
  it is recommended  to use emulation providers:
  POSIX_AIO_Dev_Poll_Provider and POSIX_AIO_SUN_Port_Provider
  
  IOTerabit:
  AsynchChannel - improved logic of processing write queue.
  

Version Terabit2_556.8
-------------------------
  TProactor:
  Minor improvements in TRB_SSL_Asynch_Stream.

  IOTerabit:
  Fixed bug in ChannelManager 
  (potential deadlock in free_channel method)

  Added SSL support as new library IOTerabit_SSL:
  new class SslChannel
  


Version Terabit2_556.7
-------------------------

 TProactor:
 Everywhere where the ACE_Message_Block is passed as a parameter of asynch.
 operation, it is possible to use direct raw buffer (char *) or iovec. 

 This is done via helper class :

   class TPROACTOR_Export Buffer_Info
   {
   private:
     union
     {
         ACE_Message_Block  *message_block_ptr_;
         char               *buffer_;
         iovec              *iov_;
     };

     // iov_count_ as switch
     // > 0  : select iov_
     //   0  : select buffer_
     // < 0  : select message_block_ptr_
     int    iov_count_;

   public:

     Buffer_Info (char *buffer = 0);
     Buffer_Info (iovec *iov, int iovcnt);
     Buffer_Info (ACE_Message_Block &mb);

     int     get_iov_count () const;
     char   *get_buffer (void) const;
     iovec  *get_iov (void) const;
     ACE_Message_Block * get_message_block_ptr() const;
   };

 Added new library IOTerabit.
